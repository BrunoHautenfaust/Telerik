**Q:** What does the XML language represent? What is it used for?

**A:** XML(eXtensible Markup Language) is used for storing and sharing data. It's similar in that it uses tags just like HTML. But with XML the user defines the tags. In HTML they are already predefined. And HTML is conscerned more with how the data IS visualized.

**Q:** What do namespaces represent in an XML document? What are they used for?

**A:** Namespaces in XML are used to avoid conflicting element names. If we have 2 tags <table> where one is defining an HTML table tag and the other one a piece of furniture, a name conflict would occur. Or if we take data from one XML into another one and we don't have namespaces, the same thing would happen. That's why it's better to use namespaces.
